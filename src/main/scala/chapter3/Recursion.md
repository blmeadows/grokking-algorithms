# Recursion

- Every recursive function has two parts:
    - Base case
    - Recursive case
- Stack:
    - A stack is a simple data structure with two actions, push and pop.
    - The computer uses a stack internally called the _call stack_.
    - When you call a function from another function, the calling function is paused in a partially completed state.
    - The call stack is used to save the variables for multiple functions.
    - Each function call takes up some memory. If the stack is too tall, there are two option:
        - Rewrite the code to use a loop instead.
        - Use _tail recursion_. Not discussed in depth in this book but is available in Scala.
            - If a recursive function calls itself as the last action, the stack frame of the function can be reused.
            - The `@tailrec` annotation can be used to require tail recursion of a function.
            - In Scala, only the direct recursive call to that function are optimized.
- Recap:
    - Recursion is when a function calls itself.
    - Every recursive function has two cases: the base case and the recursive case.
    - A stack has two operations: push and pop.
    - All function calls go onto the call stack.
    - The call stack can get very large, which takes up a lot of memory.
